<h1>Installation</h1>

OpenCart can be installed on any web server running:
Apache
PHP 5
MySQL

An older version of OpenCart is available for users who are running PHP 4, however this version is not fully
supported and may not include all of the features described in this document.

1. Obtain the latest version of OpenCart from www.opencart.com.
Extract the package to a temporary folder.


2. Connect to your web server (for example, using an FTP client or upload utility).
Copy the “upload” folder to a location on the web server, within the document root. This can be any location of
your choice, for example:
public_html or public_html/store, etc.
For the remainder of this document, your chosen install location will be referred to as <install dir>.


3. If your web server is running Linux/Unix, make sure the following folders and files are writable:

<install dir>/image/ CHMOD to 0777
<install dir>/image/cache/ CHMOD to 0777
<install dir>/cache/ CHMOD to 0777
<install dir>/download/ CHMOD to 0777
<install dir>/config.php CHMOD to 0777
<install dir>/admin/config.php CHMOD to 0777


4. Create the database
If you do not already have a database created, create a new MySQL database for OpenCart and assign a user
to it. Retain the database name and database username and password, as this information is required by the
installer.
For security reasons, do NOT use your root username and password when creating the database user!
